EMx24 Exercise 4:

The idea is that you will have one list ('data') and each
item/element in that list is itself a list. Those sublists 
each correspond to one row from the data file.

Like this: 
list_of_lists = []
then after reading in the file:
list of lists = [[1, 2, 3], 
			  	 [4, 5, 6],  <- one row from file
			  	 [7, 8, 9]]
